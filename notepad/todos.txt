Shree Ganesh :-

internationalization

animation

passing props to component that are being created in a parallel router-outlet
  and also the props are getting updated over time.
   so use observable instead.


Lifecycle hooks
create seprate modules for each sample folder

Observables and Subject

1 test module ....

Leave animation not working
