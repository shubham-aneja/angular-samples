14  RESOLVED
    Animations not working with proper transitions .
    active -> inactive, but it works for void > active and void > inactive
    :- The issue was only with the reference, I was updating the object reference,
      which lead to reacreation of that object ?? I guess ..

15
    Related to que#14, how to update an object. Like update object state on click,
      from active to inactive.
    With reference updation, it was creating problem with animation transition as in que 14
    and with same reference update, it was creating problem as in Todos project,
    that task is getting marked as completed but still remains in active panel
      (re-rendering not worked done then, I guess? ).

    How do component update..
      If two components are siblings,
        then if I make a change in one, other will also update?
        If yes, then is there any way to control this.
        If no, then it's been determined that change is performed for
          its sibling, not for that component.

Issues in reactive form detail [23-28]

23. RESOLVED

    How they are returning data here
      getHeroes(): Observable<Hero[]> {
          return of(heroes).delay(this.delayMs); // simulate latency with delay
        }

     return of(newHero).delay(this.delayMs); // simulate latency with delay

    :- THIS IS OF OPERATOR IN OBSERVABLE ...

      SRC - D:\shubham\projects\angular2\angular-samples\src\app\samples\forms\reactive-forms\reactive-form-depth\hero.service.ts


24     RESOLVED
      Related to first
      On receiving data from above observable, how are they using it like this
            this.heroes = this.heroService.getHeroes()
      Since observables can be used only with subscribe ...
      :- THEY ARE USING ASYNC PIPES

25    ???
      secretLairs: this.fb.array([]),
        Shouldn't we have to specify here that it is an array
          of Address. ??
      OR can we type of array elements in FORM BUILDER

26      RESOLVED
      What ngOnChanges is doing
        :- It is updating form values in FormGroup with the latest value
          of hero.
         eg. for the very first time, when user changes hero from navigation
         On Revert - it is resetting FormGroup with the stale hero data,
            that user wanted to be set(this is what revert means)
         On Submit - ?? Que - 27 or 28



<----save

27    RESOLVED
      prepareSaveHero()
        why create deep copy, why don't just pass the original address
          objects and array
       :- A user's subsequent changes to a lair street would mutate an address street in the saveHero.

28    Resolved
      How  hero is updating in list componentj post save
        when updating in only form component
      :-Hero-service is updating in refernce of hero object, which is being
      shared by hero-detail and hero-list both.



29     What submit is calling ngOnChanges
          Why updating name and address on submit
          In short, why it is calling ngOnChanges
            Even it is resetting super power and side kick thing.

          I guess this is just for the sake of resetting the state.
  <----save

29    RESOLVED
      What is going in Revert
      :-revert is resetting the state by updating the formModel
           by the data of hero. That remains un-updated till save.


30  RESOLVED
    ngOnChanges not working on name changes...
      Working on submit and reset, that too triggered by those function itself.
      :- That is working dude, when hero-list updates the [hero] property.
          eg. for the very first time, when user changes hero from navigation
