14  RESOLVED
    Animations not working with proper transitions .
    active -> inactive, but it works for void > active and void > inactive
    :- The issue was only with the reference, I was updating the object reference,
      which lead to reacreation of that object ?? I guess ..

15
    Related to que#14, how to update an object. Like update object state on click,
      from active to inactive.
    With reference updation, it was creating problem with animation transition as in que 14
    and with same reference update, it was creating problem as in Todos project,
    that task is getting marked as completed but still remains in active panel
      (re-rendering not worked done then, I guess? ).
